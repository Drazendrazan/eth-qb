# A̲b̲o̲u̲t̲:
# • A very close resemblance to NP carbombs.

# F̲e̲a̲t̲u̲r̲e̲s̲:
# - A very advanced defuse system which includes:
#   • The Min Speed is the minimum speed they have to be in order to not get blown up, (if I set it to 50mph and Im under 50mph then I will explode in x ticks)
#   • The Ticks before explosion is how many ticks will be able to be heard before the car gets blown up (If I set it to 5 then I will hear 5 beeps before my car explodes)
#   • The Removal Length is how long I have to stay above / at the minimum speed before the bomb gets defused.
#   • The grid size is for the minigame after using the bomb mirror, it defines how many rows and colums it needs (If I set this to 5, the minigame will be 5x5)
#   • The Time to Complete is for the minigame, which there is math done on it so the start time is 1/4 the time of the time to complete, so I have x amount of seconds to see the cubes, and x amount of seconds to choose those cubes or the vehicle blows up.
